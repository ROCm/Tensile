Tensile installation
********************************************************************

Install ROCm
============

To begin, install ROCm for your platform. For installation instructions, refer to the `Linux <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html>`_ or `Windows <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/index.html>`_ installation guide.

.. tip::

   If using Bash, set ``PATH=/opt/rocm/bin/:$PATH`` in your ``~/.bashrc`` and refresh your shell using ``source ~/.bashrc``.
   Alternatively, export the path exclusively for your current shell session, using ``export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin/:$PATH``.

Install OS dependencies
=========================


.. note::
   The steps below are for Ubuntu. For other distributions, use the appropriate package manager.

1. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block::

    apt-get install libyaml python3-yaml \
        libomp-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

2. Install one of the following, depending on your preferred Tensile data format. If both are installed, ``msgpack`` is preferred:

   .. code-block::

      apt-get install libmsgpack-dev    # If using the msgpack backend

      # OR

      apt-get install libtinfo-dev      # If using the YAML backend

3. Install build tools. For additional installation methods for the latest versions of CMake, see the `CMake installation <https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/intro/installing.html>`_ page.

   .. code-block::

      apt-get install build-essential cmake

Install Tensile from source
============================

To install Tensile from source, it is recommended to create a virtual environment first:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate

Then, you can install Tensile using pip or git.

Option 1: Install with pip
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  pip3 install git+https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/Tensile.git@develop


Option 2: Install with git
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:ROCm/Tensile.git && cd Tensile
  pip3 install .

You can now run Tensile's Python applications.

Running benchmark
===================

To run a benchmark, pass a tuning config to the ``Tensile`` program located in ``Tensile/bin``.

For demonstration purposes, the sample tuning file available in ``Tensile/Configs/rocblas_sgemm_example.yaml`` is used.
The sample tuning file allows you to specify the target architecture for which the benchmark will generate a library.
To find your device architecture, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   rocminfo | grep gfx

Specify the device architecture in the sample tuning file using ``ArchitectureName:``. Based on the device architecture, use ``ArchitectureName: "gfx90a"`` or ``ArchitectureName: "gfx1030"``.

You can now run benchmarks using Tensile. From the top-level directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build && cd build
   ../Tensile/bin/Tensile ../Tensile/Configs/rocblas_sgemm_example.yaml ./

After the benchmark completes, Tensile creates the following directories:

- **0_Build**: Contains a client executable. Use this to launch Tensile from a library viewpoint.
- **1_BenchmarkProblems**: Contains all the problem descriptions and executables generated during benchmarking. Use the ``run.sh`` script to reproduce results.
- **2_BenchmarkData**: Contains the raw performance results of all kernels in CSV and YAML formats.
- **3_LibraryLogic**: Contains the winning (optimal) kernel configurations in YAML format. Typically, rocBLAS takes the YAML files from this folder.
- **4_LibraryClient**: Contains the code objects, kernels, and library code. This is the output of running ``TensileCreateLibrary`` using the ``3_LibraryLogic`` directory as an input.
