# Configure the rocblas package to be used in another cmake project.
#
# Defines the following variables:
#
#  Tensile_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories for rocblas
#
# Also defines the library variables below as normal
# variables.  These contain debug/optimized keywords when

#-----------------------
# Example Usage:
#
# find_package( tensile REQUIRED CONFIG
#     HINTS <Tensile_ROOT>/package )
#
#    add_executable( foo foo.cc )

#    # uses imported targets from package, including setting header paths
