This document provides the guidelines for contributing to the Tensile source code.

   If you haven't already, please review :ref:`getting-started` for an introduction to the project. For details on environment setup and day-to-day development processes, please refer to the :ref:`programmers-guide`.

Tensile's development practice is based on the `Gitflow workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`_. The **develop** branch is the default branch for development, where all new features and bug fixes are merged. After a PR is merged into **develop**, it undergoes extended testing and profiling. If these checks pass, the PR might be merged into **staging** to be included in the next release. A PR is available in the upcoming release only if it is merged before the release branch is cut.

============================
Submitting a Pull Request
============================

**Forking Pull Request (PR):**

1. Create a fork of Tensile---please do not create feature branches directly in https://github.com/ROCm/Tensile.
2. Clone your fork locally and set up your :ref:`development-environment`.
3. Create a feature branch off of **develop** and make changes to the code.
4. Issue ``tox run -m precommit`` and ensure that all checks pass.
5. Commit you changes using the convention for :ref:`commit-messages`.
6. If you are updating documentation, issue ``tox run -e docs`` and verify the styling and formatting is what you expect.
7. Push the changes to your fork.

.. tip::

   Keeping the scope of new PRs as narrow as possible improves the chances it will be accepted. If you are making multiple changes, consider breaking them into separate PRs. Keeping PRs small supports timely code reviews, traceability, and straightforward reversions.

**When opening a PR:**

1. Ensure that **your develop** branch is up-to-date with the **upstream develop** branch---this may require a rebase or a merge.
2. Verify that your changes pass static analysis checks and all pre-checkin, host library, and unit tests by running ``tox run -m prepr``---then go get a coffee, this could take up to an hour.
3. Create the PRs against the https://github.com/ROCm/Tensile **develop** branch.
4. Fill in as many details as possible. Include a description, outcomes, notable changes, and environment information. This more information, the more likely the PR will be reviewed and merged in a timely manner.
5. Title the PR in present imperative tense, e.g., "*Update* kernel parameters" not "Updates" nor "Updated".

.. tip::

   If you need to merge **develop** into your feature branch after a PR is opened, use a merge instead of a rebase.

   In general, refrain from force pushing once a feature branch is in PR as it is prone to gotchas in our CI system. Ideally, the git history is linear and clean *before* a PR is created. As such we encourage contributors to conduct any rebases or amends prior to opening a PR.

**Once all checks pass and the PR is approved:**

1. Ensure the title of the PR properly describes the changes, update if necessary.
2. Squash and merge the PR---if you are not a maintainer, a maintainer will do this for you. When merging a large change, use bullet points in the commit message to break down the changes.

Conventions and style guide
===========================

-------------------
General conventions
-------------------

1. Always use space indentation (4 spaces)---never commit a tab, e.g., ``\t``.

------------------
Python doc-strings
------------------

Tensile uses `autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_ to pull in documentation from doc-strings and integrate them into this site. Please use the following guidelines when writing Python functions and modules to maintain quality and consistency.

1. The all parameters and returned values should be identified with type-hints.
2. All functions should have a doc-string describing the parameters, return value, and any exception; however, if the function is small and the implementation is straightforward, a one-line doc-string is sufficient.
3. Do not include types directly in the doc-string, these should be added as type-hints in the function definition.
4. For doc-string styling, use the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings>`_.


.. _commit-messages:

---------------
Commit messages
---------------

1. Use `conventional commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/>`_.
2. Use the present imperative tense, e.g., "add" not "adds" nor "added".
3. Don't add a period (``.``) to the end of the message.
