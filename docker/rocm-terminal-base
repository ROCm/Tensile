# This dockerfile is meant to be personalized, and serves as a template and demonstration.
# Modify it directly, but it is recommended to copy this dockerfile into a new build context (directory),
# modify to taste and modify docker-compose.yml.template to build and run it.

# It is recommended to control docker containers through 'docker-compose' https://docs.docker.com/compose/
# Docker compose depends on a .yml file to control container sets
# rocm-setup.sh can generate a useful docker-compose .yml file
# `docker-compose run --rm <rocm-terminal>`

# If it is desired to run the container manually through the docker command-line, the following is an example
# 'docker run -it --rm -v [host/directory]:[container/directory]:ro <user-name>/<project-name>'.
