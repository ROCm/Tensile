Tensile is a tool for creating benchmark-driven backend libraries for GEMMs, GEMM-like problems (such as batched GEMM), and general N-dimensional tensor contractions on a GPU.
The Tensile library is mainly used as a backend library for rocBLAS.
Tensile acts as the performance backbone for a wide variety of 'compute' applications running on AMD GPUs.
