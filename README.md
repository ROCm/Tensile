Tensile is a tool for creating benchmark-driven backend libraries for GEMMs, GEMM-like problems (such as batched GEMM), and general N-dimensional tensor contractions on a GPU.
The Tensile library is mainly used as backend library to rocBLAS.
Tensile acts as the performance backbone for a wide variety of 'compute' applications running on AMD GPUs.

See [Tensile Wiki](https://github.com/ROCm/Tensile/wiki) for documentation.
