nightly_asm is collection of selected asm tests from the nightly run
These provide better covereage than pre_checkin and skip the source tests so complete more quickly than full nightly.

nightly_asm is simply links into directories in nightly.
New directories in nightly will have to add a link in nightly_asm if desired.

To run:

$  PYTHONPATH=. py.test -v Tensile/Tests/nightly_asm
