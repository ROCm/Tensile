/**
 * \mainpage 
 * 
 * Tensile is a tool for creating a library of tensor contractions, including
 * matrix multiplications in a benchmark-driven manner.
 * 
 * The host library contains classes and functions for selecting one or more
 * kernels to launch to solve a particular problem, and then launching those
 * kernels.  Kernels are selected based on the performance on a particular GPU
 * (from the benchmark runs) as well as the limitations and applicability of
 * the kernels to particular problem sizes.
 *
 * Design goals for the host library include:
 *  - A library that requires no generated code on the host
 *  - Kernel selection configured via a file
 *      - No recompilation needed to enable a different set of kernels.
 *  - Kernel selection & determination of kernel launches decoupled from host
 *  runtime language
 *      - Eliminate as much of the Hip and OpenCL-specific code as possible
 *  - Support future work including implicit GEMMs
 *  - Use modern C++
 *  - Eliminate the need for client code to call intricately named functions
 *    such as `tensile_Cijk_Ailk_Bljk_SB()`.
