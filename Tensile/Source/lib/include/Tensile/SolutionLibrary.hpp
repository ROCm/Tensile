     * @brief Abstract base class for Library objects that can provide a
     * mapping from `Problem` and `Hardware` objects to Solution objects.
     * 
     * A complete SolutionLibrary is a tree of objects which each handles a
     * single aspect of selecting a solution for a given problem. Each node in
     * the tree will handle an aspect such as:
     * - Compatibility with a particular model of GPU
     * - Selecting kernels that solve a particular type of problem (transpose,
     *   data type, etc.)
     * - Selecting the fastest kernel based on benchmark results or other logic
     * - Ensuring that a problem is compatible with any assumptions made by a
     *   particular kernel (e.g. size or stride requirements)
     * 
     * A particular complete library might look like:
     * - Master library which manages serialization
     *   - GPU selection
     *     - Problem type selection
     *        - Predicated logic for specific sizes
     *          - Matching library based on benchmarks
     *            - Individual kernels
