 * @brief Abstract base class for Library objects that can provide a
 * mapping from `Problem` and `Hardware` objects to Solution objects.
 *
 * A complete SolutionLibrary is a tree of objects which each handles a
 * single aspect of selecting a solution for a given problem. Each node in
 * the tree will handle an aspect such as:
 * - Compatibility with a particular model of GPU
 * - Selecting kernels that solve a particular type of problem (transpose,
 *   data type, etc.)
 * - Selecting the fastest kernel based on benchmark results or other logic
 * - Ensuring that a problem is compatible with any assumptions made by a
 *   particular kernel (e.g. size or stride requirements)
 *
 * A particular complete library might look like:
 * - Master library which manages serialization
 *   - GPU selection
 *     - Problem type selection
 *        - Predicated logic for specific sizes
 *          - Matching library based on benchmarks
 *            - Individual kernels
