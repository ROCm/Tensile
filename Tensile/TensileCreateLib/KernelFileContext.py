    Decides to open existing files for appending or create new ones based on **numMergedFiles**,
    **mergeFiles**, **lazyLoading**, and the presence of **kernelFiles** with the following branching:
    1. If **numMergedFiles** > 1 and **kernelFiles** is not empty, it opens files based on the first kernel file name.
    2. If **mergeFiles** or **lazyLoading** is enabled, it opens fixed-named files for appending: Kernels.cpp and Kernels.h.
    3. If **mergeFiles** or **lazyLoading** is False, it returns (None, None) to indicate no that
       files are not to be merged, and it is the caller's responsibility to handle file creation.
