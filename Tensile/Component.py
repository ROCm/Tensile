"""
A component is a piece of code that is chosen among compatible components based on the current hardware capabilities and/or kernel options.

The class hierarchy is automatically used to detect which type of component a given class belongs to. For example, all the MAC components should inherit from the MAC class.

Most components should be able to get away with defining their requirements via the class properties (e.g.):

```python
    class FMA_NonPacked(MAC):
        asmCaps = {"v_fma_f16": True,
                "v_pk_fma_f16": False}
        #archCaps = {}
        kernel = {"ProblemType": {"DataType": DataType(DataType.half),
                                "HighPrecisionAccumulate": False}}
```

Values in the dictionaries can be lambdas for more advanced logic:

```python
    class FMA_HPA_MAD_MIX(MAC):
        asmCaps = {"v_mad_mix_f32": True}
        #archCaps = {}
        kernel = {"ProblemType": {"DataType": DataType(DataType.half),
                                "HighPrecisionAccumulate": True},
                "LocalDotLayout": lambda ldl: ldl > 1
                }
```

Any more advanced logic should be implemented by overriding the matches() method.

Components are found by calling `Component.<subtype>.find(writer)` where `writer` is a `KernelWriter` object:

```python
    component = Component.MAC.find(self)
    if component:
      return component(self, m, innerUnroll)

    # No component was found, fall back to existing code...
```

With this fallback mechanism, components can be added one at a time, without disrupting existing code.

Components can be categorized in different files in the `Tensile/Components` directory.  Each file should be listed in the `__all__` member of `Tensile/Components/__init__.py`.
