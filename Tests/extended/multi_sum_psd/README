1sum,2sum,3sum : refer to number of summation dimensions used in the test
psd : PackSummationDims. These tests set PackSummationDims=1
gsu : GlobalSplitU - PSD and GSU interact so have specific tests for the combination
_simple: test is a simple starter test that generates 1-2 solutions and 1-4 problem sizes.  Useful 
   for initial debug if something fails.
   If test does not contain _simple it generates many solutions and many problem sizes.
_ scrambled: Re-orders summation indices in a different way.

example: 3sum_gsu_simple.yaml, 2sum.yaml
